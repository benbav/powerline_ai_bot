### Powerline Bot

Originally tried reinforcement learning but it was way too slow so I eventually switched to rule based movement based on if the bot saw a wall or another player next to its head.

Limitation is using python and manual pixel scraping (cv2) since both were just too slow to be competitive online.

A possible better version would be using javascript which would be much faster and more responsive.
